Forms - action tells you where to send form data
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, 
you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. 
For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.

Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. 
That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.
